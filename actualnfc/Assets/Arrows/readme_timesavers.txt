The "Timesavers" - series is a pool of untextured building blocks, for fast and convenient modeling. It is thought to help you save more time for your creativity with your image work instead of having to build each and every object from scratch...

All objects have been tested in Carrara 6 pro, Poser 7, Hexagon 2.2 and Bryce 5 and 6.1...

Have fun!
